Parametric Design Examples

[Give parametric design a try using OpenJSCAD!](https://raw.githack.com/opencoca/OpenJSCAD-Templates/master/index.html) Parametric designs are models that can be altered by simply changing parameters.  These designs are great for if you want to change the size, appearance, or any other aspects of a design without needing to go back and remake it from scratch each time.

OpenJSCAD is an open-source program used to generate parametric models simply by writing code. That means that there are no complicated tools needed to generate complex shapes. More over OpenJSCAD runs in browser, so there is no software installation needed. The only requirement is that you have a recent browser with the HTML5 canvas element.
